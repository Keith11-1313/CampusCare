### Live Demo

The application is hosted online at:

```
http://campuscare.page.gd/
```

#### How to Access

1. Open your browser and navigate to **http://campuscare.page.gd/**
2. Use the [default login credentials](#default-login-credentials) below to sign in
3. If the page does not load, follow the troubleshooting steps below

#### Troubleshooting: Cannot Access the Site

The live demo is hosted on **InfinityFree**, a free hosting provider. Some users may experience issues accessing the site due to **DNS filtering** by their Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**Why does this happen?**

InfinityFree uses shared IP addresses that host many websites. Some ISPs — particularly in the Philippines and other regions — block or filter DNS requests to these shared IPs as part of anti-phishing or content-filtering policies. This means your ISP's DNS resolver may refuse to resolve `campuscare.page.gd`, even though the site is legitimate and functional.

**How to fix it:**

- **Option 1: Use a VPN** — Turn on any VPN service (e.g., Proton VPN, Windscribe, or a browser-based VPN). This bypasses your ISP's DNS filtering entirely.
- **Option 2: Use mobile data** — Switch from Wi-Fi to your phone's mobile data connection. Mobile carriers often use different DNS resolvers that do not block InfinityFree domains.
- **Option 3: Change your DNS server** — Manually set your device's DNS to a public resolver like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`) or Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`) to bypass your ISP's filtered DNS.

---

## Requirements

- **PHP 7.4+** (with PDO MySQL and GD extensions enabled)
- **MySQL 5.7+** or MariaDB 10.3+
- **Apache** (with `mod_rewrite`) or any PHP-compatible web server
- **Node.js/npm** (for frontend dependencies)
- **Composer** (for PHP backend dependencies) — [Download here](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- **XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP** recommended for local development

## Installation

### 1. Clone / Copy Project

Place the `CampusCare` folder in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```powershell
cd CampusCare
npm install
```

This installs all packages listed in `package.json` (Bootstrap, SweetAlert2, Chart.js, Quill, etc.) into the `node_modules/` folder.

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies (Composer)

**Option A — If Composer is installed globally:**

```powershell
composer install
```

**Option B — If Composer is NOT installed globally:**

Download and run Composer directly:

```powershell
C:\xampp\php\php.exe -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
C:\xampp\php\php.exe composer-setup.php
C:\xampp\php\php.exe composer.phar install
del composer-setup.php
```

This installs the PHP packages listed in `composer.json` (Dompdf for PDF export, PHPMailer for SMTP email) into the `vendor/` folder.

> **Tip:** To install Composer globally on Windows, download the [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) installer.

### 4. Configure Email (PHPMailer / Gmail SMTP)

CampusCare uses **PHPMailer** to send OTP emails for the password-reset flow. PHPMailer is already included in `composer.json` and installed by the `composer install` command above — no separate download is needed.

#### 4a. Create a Gmail App Password

The mailer is pre-configured for **Gmail SMTP** (`smtp.gmail.com`, port 587, TLS). To use it:

1. Sign in to the Gmail account you want to send from.
2. Go to **Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification** and ensure it is **enabled**.
3. Go to **Google Account → Security → App passwords** (or visit <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>).
4. Create a new App Password — name it anything (e.g., *CampusCare*).
5. Copy the 16-character password shown (it looks like `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`).

> **Note:** The **App passwords** option is only visible when 2-Step Verification is enabled on the account.

#### 4b. Update `config/mail.php`

Open `config/mail.php` and fill in your credentials:

```php
// SMTP server settings
define('MAIL_HOST',       'smtp.gmail.com'); // SMTP host
define('MAIL_PORT',       587);              // 587 = TLS
define('MAIL_ENCRYPTION', 'tls');            // 'tls' or 'ssl'

// SMTP authentication — replace with your Gmail address & App Password
define('MAIL_USERNAME', 'your-email@gmail.com');
define('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx'); // ← 16-char App Password

// Sender identity shown to recipients
define('MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS', 'your-email@gmail.com');
define('MAIL_FROM_NAME',    'CampusCare');

// OTP behaviour
define('OTP_LENGTH',          6);  // digits
define('OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES', 10);  // minutes until the OTP expires
define('OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS',    5);  // failed attempts before lockout
define('OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN', 30); // seconds before a resend is allowed
```

#### 4c. Run the OTP table migration

The password-reset OTP feature requires one extra table. Run the migration file in **phpMyAdmin** or via MySQL CLI:

```sql
USE campuscare;
SOURCE database/migrations/add_password_reset_otps.sql;
```

Alternatively, open the file and paste its contents directly into a phpMyAdmin SQL tab.

> **Tip:** If you are using the bundled `database/real-data/campuscare.sql` schema, the `password_reset_otps` table may already be included. Check before running the migration to avoid duplicate-table errors.

#### 4d. Verify the setup

1. Start XAMPP (Apache + MySQL).
2. Open `http://localhost/CampusCare/login.php`.
3. Click **Forgot Password → Reset via Email OTP**.
4. Enter a valid username that has an email address on record.
5. Check the inbox — an OTP email should arrive within a few seconds.

If no email arrives, check **Apache error logs** (`C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`) for PHPMailer error messages and verify your App Password and Gmail 2-Step Verification settings.

### 5. Create the Database

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** or MySQL CLI
2. Create a database named `campuscare` (for local development):

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE campuscare;
   ```

3. Import/Paste the schema:

   ```sql
   USE campuscare;
   SOURCE database/real-data/campuscare.sql;
   ```

4. Import/Paste the seed data (for ready-to-go data):

   ```sql
   SOURCE database/real-data/seed_data.sql;
   ```

### 6. Configure the credentials (ignore for localhost)

Edit `config/config.php` to match your database credentials:

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'campuscare');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', '');
```

Also update `BASE_URL` if not using the default:

```php
define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/CampusCare');
```

### 7. Enable PHP GD Extension (ignore as it is enabled by default)

The GD extension is required for PDF export with images. In your `php.ini`, make sure this line is **uncommented**:

```ini
extension=gd
```

For XAMPP, the `php.ini` file is at `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`. After editing, **restart Apache**.

### 8. Start the Server

Start Apache & MySQL in XAMPP, then visit:

```text
http://localhost/CampusCare
```
